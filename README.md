* Project: xv6 Memory Mapping
- In this project, you're going to learn more about the memory management subsystem in xv6. In this process, you will improve some existing mechanisms in xv6 to provide a more secure and performant system.
- Additionally, you will implement a new functionality which allows the user to map files into memory.
- To provide better security, you will change existing xv6 to set correct protection for different program sections.
- Moreover, you will increase the performance by using copy-on-write when a process forks.
- Finally, you will support memory mappings through a pair of system calls, wmap and wunmap.

* Deadline: 01 December 2024
